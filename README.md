Getting Started

Prerequisites

Node.js (v14+ recommended)

npm or Yarn

(Optional) access to the backend API or a mock server


Installation

Fork / clone this repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-dashboard-frontend.git
cd student-dashboard-frontend

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
# or
yarn install

Running Locally

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```
This should start a local server (e.g. at http://localhost:3000) where you can see the login page and work with the UI.


---

Configuration & Environment Variables

Create a .env.local or .env file in the root. Typical variables:

VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
VITE_AUTH_ENDPOINT=/auth/login
VITE_TOKEN_REFRESH_ENDPOINT=/auth/refresh
VITE_APP_TITLE="Campus One"
# etc.

Adjust variable names depending on your framework (e.g. NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix in Next.js).

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

On login, frontend sends credentials to the auth API endpoint (e.g. /login).

On success, receives a JWT (access token) and possibly a refresh token.

Store token (e.g. in localStorage or HttpOnly cookie ‚Äî prefer security best practices).

Attach token in headers (Authorization: Bearer <token>) for protected API calls.

Redirect to login when token is missing or invalid (401 responses).

Role-based UI control: e.g. hide admin-only features from students.



---

API Integration

Use a dedicated apiClient (e.g. axios.create(...)) that has base URL and interceptors.

Example endpoints:
```

GET /students/me

GET /courses

GET /courses/:courseId/assignments

POST /assignments/:id/submit

GET /announcements

PUT /profile

```

If backend is under development, you can use mock APIs or JSON server.



---

Styling & UI Components

Use a component library or design system for consistency.

Theme support (dark/light) optional.

Responsive grid / layout support.

Use CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind, Emotion, or equivalent.



---

Scripts

Here are common NPM scripts you might include:

Script	Description

dev	start development server
build	build production bundle
start	serve production build
lint	run linting (ESLint, Prettier)
test	run unit / integration tests
format	auto format code


Example in package.json:
```

{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "serve": "vite preview",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx,.js",
    "format": "prettier --write .",
    "test": "vitest"
  }
}
```


---

Testing

Use Jest / Vitest / React Testing Library for unit & integration tests.

Aim to test:

Components rendering

API client behavior (mocking)

Authentication flows

Edge cases (token expired, no network)


Optionally, use Cypress / Playwright for end-to-end (login, navigate dashboard).



---

Deployment

1. Build for production: npm run build


2. Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or your hosting of choice.


3. Ensure environment variables are set in the deployment environment.


4. (Optional) Setup CI/CD pipeline to auto-deploy on merge to main.



If deploying to Vercel, you may need to adjust routing rules or vercel.json.
